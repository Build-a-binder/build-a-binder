# Timeline for the workshop day

The workshop starts in the morning and ends on the same day at 5.30pm. People
are welcome to continue hanging out afterwards.

The day starts with introductions and then we have time for three sessions of
90minutes each. It might make sense to break a 90m session into two 40minute
sessions with a short break between sessions.

In between there will be lunch and coffee breaks.

9am: Doors open
9.15am: Welcome, admin, safety, CoC, goal of the day
9.30: Introduction round, who are you, what do you want to get out of this,
9.45: Introduction to binder
10.05: Binder showcase
10.30: coffee break
11.00: Session 1

12.30pm: Lunch (we order in or go to local canteen or ..?)
1.30pm: Welcome back
1.31: Session 2
3.00: Coffee break
